# Validation protocol

The scripts needed to perform the validation protocol are contained into the [MAM validation](https://github.com/gmtiddia/ngpu_mam_validation.git) reopository.

In the following, we provide the plots that results from the validation performed in the context of this work. The directory sample_plots returns the Figures X and Y of the Appendix Z of the manuscript, whereas 
in emd_all_areas are reported the values of the Earth Mover Distance collected for each area of the MAM for the three distributions of the spike statistics.
